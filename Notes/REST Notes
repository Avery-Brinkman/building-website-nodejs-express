REST
Representational State Transfer

Most common used pattern for APIs

HTTP Verbs and REST
    .get    --- Request a resource
    .post   --- Create a resource
    .put    --- Update a resource
    .delete --- Delete a resource

    Normal routes return HTML
    REST returns data (usually JSON)

Create, Update, and Delete (CRUD) via REST
    HTTP GET http://mysite.com/users
        Getting all users
    HTTP POST (payload) http://mysite.com/users
        Creating a new user
    HTTP GET http://mysite.com/users/42
        Getting the user with the ID 42
    HTTP PUT (payload) http://mysite.com/users/42
        Updating user ID
    HTTP DELETE http://mysite.com/users/42
        Deleting user with ID 42

REST in Web Applications

    [Browser]   ---HTTP GET http://mysite.com-->  [Back end]
    [Browser]   <--HTML page with JavaScript ---  [Back end]

    | Browser | <-- XHR (AJAX) --- | Back end |
    | [ JS ]  | ---    REST    --> |          |
